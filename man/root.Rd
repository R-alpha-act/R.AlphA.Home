\title{Get Root Directory of Current Source File}
\usage{
root(..., includeFName = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{...}{Path components to append to the root directory. If empty, returns only
the directory path. If provided, builds a path using \code{file.path()}.}

\item{includeFName}{Logical. If \code{TRUE}, returns the full file path including
the filename instead of just the directory. Ignored if \code{...} is provided.}
}
\value{
A character string representing either:
\itemize{
  \item The absolute path of the directory containing the current source file (default)
  \item The full absolute path including the filename (if \code{includeFName = TRUE})
  \item A path built from the root directory and the provided components (if \code{...} given)
}
}
\description{
Returns the directory path where the current source code file
is located, optionally the full file path, or builds a path relative to it.

This function is especially useful when the same source code is used by multiple users,
each using their own environment with different file paths. It helps avoid writing
full paths in raw text inside source codes by dynamically retrieving the location
of the currently active source file in RStudio.
}
\note{
This function requires RStudio and will only work within the RStudio IDE.
It relies on \code{rstudioapi::getSourceEditorContext()} to retrieve the active
source file location.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# Get only the directory path of the current source file
my_dir <- root()
print(my_dir)
# Example output: "/home/user/my_project/R"

# Get the full path including filename
my_file <- root(includeFName = TRUE)
print(my_file)
# Example output: "/home/user/my_project/R/my_script.R"

# Build a path relative to root
data_path <- root("data", "input.csv")
print(data_path)
# Example output: "/home/user/my_project/R/data/input.csv"
}
