\title{Get Root Directory of Current Source File}
\usage{
root(includeFName = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{includeFName}{Logical. If \code{FALSE} (default), returns only the directory path.
If \code{TRUE}, returns the full file path including the filename.}
}
\value{
A character string representing either:
\itemize{
  \item The absolute path of the directory containing the current source file (if \code{includeFName = FALSE})
  \item The full absolute path including the filename (if \code{includeFName = TRUE})
}
}
\description{
Returns the directory path where the current source code file
is located, or optionally the full file path including filename.

This function is especially useful when the same source code is used by multiple users,
each using their own environment with different file paths. It helps avoid writing
full paths in raw text inside source codes by dynamically retrieving the location
of the currently active source file in RStudio.
}
\note{
This function requires RStudio and will only work within the RStudio IDE.
It relies on \code{rstudioapi::getSourceEditorContext()} to retrieve the active
source file location.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# Get only the directory path of the current source file
my_dir <- root()
print(my_dir)
# Example output: "/home/user/my_project/R"

# Get the full path including filename
my_file <- root(includeFName = TRUE)
print(my_file)
# Example output: "/home/user/my_project/R/my_script.R"
}

}
